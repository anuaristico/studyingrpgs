# Studying connections between classic RPGs using networks

In short, an RPG is a game in which a person tells a story that is enacted by the players who are given roles as the various pieces of background information. Challenges related to the story are then presented and must be addressed by all participants. Each player represents a character in the story and is attributed (quantitatively-defined) skills. These skills are tested during the game to decide if the character succeeds in his or her attempt to perform a task that solves the problem or overcomes the challenge [1].

Over the years, RPGs have been incorporated into the virtual world of video games. Dragon Age, Mass Effect and Baldurâ€™s Gate were some of the first (and classic) titles released, which were later transformed into successful franchises. For this work, a network of links present on each of the Wikipedia pages referring to these franchises was created, in an attempt to investigate the relationship between them. It is important to highlight that due to machine limitations, only up to the second layer of links were analyzed.

The creation of the network is *detailed* in the notebook within the source folder.
